# Random Bash Scripts
Linux has always been mostly a personal passion, not much to deal with it at school. I wanted to learn Bash programming so later I could have built the whole thing from scratch, from the book that's called - guess what? Linux from Scratch! Of course I abandoned my plan after the first kernel panic because I was too scared of losing all my stuff on my /home partition. Never mind! Also I learned it in order to be able to fix things on my laptop that runs like almost always the Linux Mint operating system instead of Windows.
