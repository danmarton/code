# Hello!

Yeah, it's me: Dani!!! This is my "personal" folder with all sorts of random code I wrote in order to practice all sorts of different programming languages & stuff. The assembly & C# codes were written with the purpose of preparing for school exams while the rest of them was wrote mostly because of personal interests. 

Please do take a look at the files & have a nice day!

Cheers,
Daniel Marton
