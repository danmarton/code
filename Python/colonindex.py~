#The colon indicates a range of indexes between the numbers standing left and right.
#list[x:y] -> list indexes starting with x, stopping at y.
#The index to the left is included but the index to the right is not!
#This is inspired by the for(int i=0; i<10; i++) in C-like languages.
#The iteration includes i=0, but not i=10
