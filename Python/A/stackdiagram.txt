The stack diagram is a very nice visual illustration of a running program!

Here is how you can create one:

    1. The first line is that of the main program. Write down the variable assignments one by one as they happen,
    until the first function call. If the function will return something, write the name of the variable having to
    store the result and leave it there. (If the list is repeating some pattern, you can shorten it with ellipsis.) 

    2. Create a new line for the called function and do the same procedure, starting at the beginning of the line.
    
    3. Repeat creating new lines and writing down the variable assignments until one function finally returns.

    4. Now you can move up one line and assign the variable if there's one waiting. Go back in your code to the
    function of this line and write down the remaining assignments if there are any.

    5. If there's a new function call, you can start it on the line below. The function there has already terminated
    so she doesn't need it anymore. Just draw a vertical line and go ahead. (If the same functions are called many
    times, use ellipsis.)
    
    6. Go on until you reach the end of the main program.
    

You can write a stack diagram with a simple text editor. It doesn't have to be very graphical...

To make the diagram more clear, function calls and their surrounding calculations (with variable names substituted) can be written into the appropriate assignments, followed by their results. See the example!

NOTE: 
More telling (and more complex) diagrams are to be found in the Unified Modeling Language.
These are canonized specifications of diagrams used by thousands of software engineers worldwide.
